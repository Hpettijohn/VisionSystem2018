# VisionSystem2018
## Short Description:
VisionSystem is a targeting and computer vision system developed for use during the 2018 FIRST Robotics competition.  
It will *eventually* be able to detect and estimate the pose of an arbitrary number of planar polygons in three-dimensional space.  
This program is currently a work in progress!
